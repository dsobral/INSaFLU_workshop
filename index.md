# INSaFLU Workshop

## Learning Objectives:
  - Broad description of the INSaFLU platform
  - Upload data and associated metadata to INSaFLU
  - Generate consensus sequences and characterize them
  - Perform phylogenetic and geotemporal analysis using NextStrain in INSaFLU
 
## Learning Outcomes:

  - [**1**: Broadly describe the INSaFLU platform](#LO1)

  - [**2**: Upload data and associated metadata to INSaFLU](#LO2)
    + [**2.1**: Prepare the reads and metadata](#LO2.1)
    + [**2.2**: Configure the settings for preprocessing](#LO2.2)
    + [**2.3**: Upload data and metadata and evaluate preprocessing results](#LO2.3)

  - [**3**: Generate consensus sequences and characterize them](#LO3)
    + [**3.1**: Create a project and configure settings](#LO3.1)
    + [**3.2**: Add samples to project and analyze results](#LO3.2)

  - [**4**: Perform phylogenetic and geotemporal analysis using NextStrain in INSaFLU](#LO4)
    + [**4.1**: Create Nextstrain project, add consensus](#LO4.1)  
    + [**4.2**: Update metadata and run the build](#LO4.2)  
    + [**4.3**: Visualize Nextstrain results](#LO4.3)

**QUESTION**: Can you broadly describe commmon steps in most high throughput sequencing workflows?
<details><summary>Click Here to see the answer</summary><p>

- Extraction and purification of the DNA template (even RNA must usually be converted to cDNA)

- Fragmentation of the DNA template (into a size range that can be accommodated by the machine)
  
- Attachment of sequencing tags (to enable reading by the machine)
  
- Amplification of signal (usually trough PCR, often already in the machine)
  
- Reading of signal and conversion into nucleotide bases
